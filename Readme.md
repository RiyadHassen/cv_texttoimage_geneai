# Textual Inversion

Textual Inversion is a novel approach to generating personalized images based on text prompts. It employs an innovative text-to-image inversion technique to synthesize images that correspond to specific textual descriptions. It enable language-guided generation of new, user-specified concepts. To do so, it uses  to encode these concepts into an intermediate representation of a pre-trained text-to-image model. Ideally, this should be done in a manner that would allow us to leverage the rich semantic and visual prior represented by such a model, and use it to guide intuitive visual transformations of the concepts.


## Method

Textual Inversion employs a sophisticated inversion algorithm to generate images based on textual prompts. Here's an overview of the method:

1. **Input**: Textual Inversion takes textual description 3-5 images as input, which serve as prompts for image generation.

2. **Objective**: The objective is to generate images that accurately reflect the textual descriptions provided as input.

3. **Text-to-Image Inversion**: Textual Inversion utilizes an inversion algorithm to reverse-engineer images from textual descriptions. This process involves decoding the textual features and mapping them to corresponding visual features.

4. **Loss Function**: The loss function guides the inversion process, ensuring that the generated images closely match the textual descriptions provided as input.

## Execution

To execute Textual Inversion, follow these general directions:

You can use the notebook to textual inversion model you can change dataset of your own.
